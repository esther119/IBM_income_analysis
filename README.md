# IBM Income Analysis 


This is a regression project that I create in my first year statisitcs class in my univeristy at Spring 2020. 
The motivation is to gain some beginner knowledge about people analytics. In this project, I obtain the data through IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance on Kaggle: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
I assess how age is correlated to monthly salary as well as other variables, such as job level and working years.
